  ## Description
------
I created this app to test my knowledge and understanding of the concepts learned in the Node JS portion of the bootcamp. This app included several portions that drew on knowledge learned earlier in the bootcamp. I had to draw from my front and back-end experience, as well as the dynamic creation of HTML pages, template literals, and etc. 

The goal of the project was to create an employee tracking system that would allow a manger to have a quick view of all their employees. Included in that view is information about the employee, based on their role within the organization. If the empoloyee was an intern, they had a school. If they were an engineer, they had a Github account. If they were a manager, they had an office number.

This project allows a team lead to see their entire team in one screen. They simply need to input information about the individual team members, and then that single pane of glass is created for them. 

While completing this project, I learned how to bring several disciplines of full-stack development together, to produce a final product. As stated earlier, this project drew on front-end knowledge, css, responsive design, and Node JS concepts. The Inquirer plugin was used to prompt the user for the information used to build the team members cards.

## Installation
------
To install the app, simply download the app, then be sure to run the "npm install" command to get the needed dependencies. Once that is done, you can run the "node index.js" command to run the app.



## Useage
------
To use the app, simply answer the questions that are asked once it is run. A manager must be entered to begin with. Once the manager's information is complete, you will be prompted to either enter an  Engineer or Intern you can also chose to exit the application at this prompt as well. Once you choose to exit the question prompts, the HTML file will then be generated in the Dist folder.  There is where you will be able to see your entered team members.
